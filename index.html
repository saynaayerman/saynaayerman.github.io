            <i>illegal civ</i>
            <ul>
              Illegal civ is a skateboarding brand of young skaters from
              california, who make videos and films and i really enjoy watching
              their clips. I also love to watch Davont Jolly's, 'a day in the
              life with the homies' videos since they make me forget about
              everything stressful, as i watch awesome skate clips.

            <i> skateboard + me </i>
            <ul>
              I would say i watch more skateboarding than actually
              skateboarding, but i have made a pact with myself for this summer
              that i will go out and skateboard more, despite how terrifying it
              seems.

            <i>movie theatres</i>
            <ul>
              Movie theatres to me brings so much nostalgia and memories of my
              childhood, i find myself always cheered up when im at the movies.
              Everything from the elite popcorn to the stale seats, there is
              just something very comforting about it all.

            <i>film</i>
            <ul>
              I love movies and watching film to a extensive degree, i find
              screenwriting to be one of the best jobs in the world. I love to
              watch films from cult classics to independent features and think
              critically about.

            <i>my soccer career</i>
            <ul>
              Currently, one of my summer goal is to increase my agility and
              strength so i can tryout for the richmond hill 03/04 rep soccer
              team in the fall. Playing soccer is a all time favourite hobby of
              mine especially since i grew up playing it from such a young age.

            <i> favourite soccer player </i>
            <ul>
              My favourite soccer player is Endison Cavani. He used to play for
              PSG and that was his prime in my opinion and now he plays for
              manchester united which i cannot say im quite happy with since its
              a premiere league team. But his game style and sportsmanship is
              definitely admirable.

      fashion is a important part of my life because i feel as though clothes
      make up a very integral part of my day. So if im wearing an outfit i feel
      comfortable in, i can take on the day better. I love to look at pieces of
      clothing online, although i may not splurge on most of them, browsing
      never hurt anybody. So here you can find an entire outfit i curated that
      links to the websites each item is from.
